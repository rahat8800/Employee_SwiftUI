# Sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.)
# Keep these out of version control!  Use environment variables instead.
# Example:
# config.json  (If you have a config file, add it, but ideally, use environment variables)

# Files that should NOT be ignored (examples)
# .gitignore  (This file itself should be tracked)
# README.md
# LICENSE
